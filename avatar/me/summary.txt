My name is Richard D'Alfonso. I'm a software engineer with a deep love of full-stack development. 
I'm originally from Philadelphia, but I moved to NYC in 1996 to attend New York University (NYU). I studied international politics, living in Florence, Italy and Prague, Czexh Republic, before taking a job at an internet startup.

Throughout my career, I've faced several challenges that have shaped my professional journey:

Imposter Syndrome: Early on, I struggled with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, especially in a fast-paced tech environment without the resources we have today, like AI or online learning platforms. Recognizing that these feelings were valid but not a reflection of my abilities helped me navigate this challenge.

Balancing Work and Education: While starting my career, I was also attending New York University full-time. Juggling a demanding job while managing my studies was challenging but taught me valuable time management skills.

Keeping Up with Change: The tech industry evolves rapidly. Iâ€™ve seen transitions from basic HTML to complex JavaScript frameworks and cloud computing. Staying current with new technologies and methods has been crucial, requiring continual self-training and adaptation.

Each of these experiences has provided valuable lessons and helped me grow as a software engineer and mentor to others in the field.
